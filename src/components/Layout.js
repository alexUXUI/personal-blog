              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado and have lived in Los Angeles,
                MedellÃ­n, and Rio de Janeiro. I have also traveled around S.E. Asia, S. Africa, and
                W. Europe.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; My path into software development and technology started with art and
                politics.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Technology fascinates me from an art perspective because it allows us to
                combine different medias in new ways. I believe that in the information age, artists
                have a major role to play in shaping our understanding of vasts amount of
                information.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;During my undergrad in Diplomacy and World Affairs at Occidental
                College, I studied the role technology can play in the formation of public policy
                and I realized that technology can be a very effective way of making a positive
                difference in the world.

              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;My 7 year professional career has revolved around creating software.
                Along the way, I have had the privilege of building software with people in many
                capacities. I have had roles in software production including: Software Engineer,
                UX/UI Designer, Product Manager, Scrum Master, and DevOps. No matter what role I'm
                in, I try to stay true to the mentality of full-cycle software operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience, I have also had the pleasure of working alongside an
                assortment of teams, on different products, using a variety of tools, within
                different industries. I have also contracted, worked full-time, and even co-founded
                a tech. company, we failed spectacularly, and the experience is still one of my
                biggest accomplishments.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of working on a range of projects, I began to specialize
                in frontend web development. I was most recently a UI Architect for a 9 billion
                dollar company called Atlas Corporation, where I was responsible for all things
                related to our frontend codebase: quality, performance, accessibility, design,
                security, and DevOps. I also built a microfrontend architecture for this company to
                extend the benefits of domain driven design and microservice architectures to the
                frontend.
