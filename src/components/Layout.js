              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado and have lived in Los Angeles,
                MedellÃ­n, and Rio de Janeiro. I have also traveled around S.E. Asia, S. Africa, and
                W. Europe as well.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; My path into software development and technology started with art and
                politics.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Technology has always fascinated me from an art perspective because it
                allows us to combine different medias in new and exciting ways. I truly believe that
                in the information age, artists have a major role to play in shaping our
                understanding of vasts amount of information through color, sounds, lines, words and
                countless forms of expression.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;During my undergrad in Diplomacy and World Affairs at Occidental
                College, I studied the role technology can play in the formation of public policy
                (local, federal, and international) and realized that technology can be a very
                effective way of making a positive difference in the world.
              </p>

              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;My 7 year professional career has solely revolved around creating
                software. Along the way, I have had the privilege of working on software with people
                in many different capacities. I have had roles in software production including:
                Software Engineer, UX/UI Designer, Product Manager, Scrum Master, and DevOps.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;I've also had the pleasure of working with many different teams, on
                different products, written in different languages, within different industries. I
                have also contracted, worked full-time, and even co-founded a tech. company.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of working on these different projects, I began to
                specialize in frontend web development. I was most recently a UI Architect for a 9
                billion dollar company called Atlas Corporation, where I was responsible for all
                things related to our frontend codebase: quality, performance, accessibility,
                design, security, and DevOps. I also built a microfrontend architecture for this
                company to extend the benefits of domain driven design and microservice
                architectures to the fontend.
