> Transduce means “to change over, convert”. 

In software development, a transducer is a performant functional programming technique for data processing and transformation. 

**What does it do?**

A transducer iterates over a collection of data and returns a new result.

Often times, in javascript, we accomplish this with `.map`, `.filter`, and `.reduce`.

```javascript
[1,2,3]
  .map(timesTwo)
  .filter(isOdd)
  .reduce(sumEntries)
```

**Why do we need to do this differently?**

This approach is not as performant as it could be. A `.` chain series of functions, like the example above, works like this:

The yellow arrows are functions, and the red lines are array items. Notice how each function needs to process all 3 items in the array before the next function is called?

This behavior _is_ the bottle-neck of the program. The problem with this approach is that each `.map`, `.filter`, and `.reduce` function iterates over the collection and creates a new array of data. There are **4 arrays** in the gif above, generated by **three iterations** of the collection. 

**How can we write a better solution?**

We can start by addressing the two main problems with the way the example program works:

1) 4 array's: there are two `intermediary collections` nestled within the input and output arrays. The intermediary collections are not _necessary_ when we only need an input and an output array


2) The program iterates over the collection `3 times`. Once with map, once with filter, and once with reduce

Let's improve this by:  

1) Removing intermediary arrays
2) Iterate over the data `1 time`, instead of three

Just to re-cap: Our goal is to iterate over a collection one time, run multiple functions on each item in the collection, and return a new result - without using intermediary collections.

Our goal could also be expressed as: we need to write a transducer. This is because a transducer works exactly as described 

Transducers have 4 parts:

main function, final function, seed and data.

Transducers solve the memory problem of 3 arrays by only iterating over the collection one time, and running multiple functions on each item. Rather than iterating over the collection three times, only  running one function on each item.
